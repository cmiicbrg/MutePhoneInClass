/**
 * Main package for the Java KUSSS api.<br/<br/>
 * 
 * <pre>Additional notes:
 * - If you have any problems using the api, feel free to contact me at david.auzinger@gmail.com (German & English)
 * - Be aware that the whole api is merely a wrapper for the KUSSS webpage. That means it can
 *   stop working entirely if the KUSSS or its design change even slightly. This is NOT my fault.
 * - Nearly all objects you get by using this api are no clones. This means that if you change
 *   e.g. an event in a TimeTable, the not only will the "instance" you are using change
 *   but also the "instance" saved in the TimeTable object. Just keep that in mind!</pre>
 * @version 0.7
