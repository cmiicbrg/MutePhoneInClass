# MutePhoneInClass

With this app, you can mute (or unmute) your phone based on available WIFI-Networks at your location.

This is a student-project and there is no guarantee everythings working without errors - although thoroughly tested.

Based on available Wifi-SSIDs you can create rules for muting or unmuting your phone.

The 0.5alpha branch corresponds to the currently published version in Play Store's alpha testing.
