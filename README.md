# MutePhoneInClass

With this app, you can mute (or unmute) your phone based on available WIFI-Networks at your location.

This is a student-project and there is no guarantee everythings working without errors - although thoroughly tested.

Based on available Wifi-SSIDs and/or the schedules retrieved from KUSSS and WebUntis you can create rules for muting or unmuting your phone. WebUntis is a widely used software for time tables for school as well as universities throughout Europe.

The master branch corresponds to the currently published version in Play Store's beta testing.
